# Fail2ban and the honeysip

Those are example configurations for Fail2ban.
I strongly advise to use fail2ban on the honeypot system to prevent spamming your honeypot.
The Honeypot itself does not have any rate limiter or DOS Protection.

You can setup a iptables allow rule for 5060/udp with limit of new connections per source IP.

Or use fail2ban to directly ban source IPs triggering the honeypot.

# configure fail2ban

-   copy the filter difinition *honeysip.conf* to your fail2ban filter dir. 
    e.g. /etc/fail2ban/filter.d/
-   edit your jail config file and add config from jail.conf e.g. to
    /etc/fail2ban/jail.d/myfilter.conf
